# Fastapi-ML
Fastapi-ML is a project that demonstrates how to deploy machine learning models using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. This repository provides a step-by-step guide to building and deploying a machine learning model API on Heroku, enabling easy integration of machine learning capabilities into web applications.

**Key features**:

- Implementation of a RESTful API using FastAPI.
- Integration of pre-trained machine learning models for inference.
- Deployment on Heroku for easy and scalable cloud hosting.
- Examples and best practices for serving machine learning models in production.

Whether you're looking to deploy your machine learning models in the cloud or explore FastAPI as a web framework, this repository serves as a practical guide for getting started.

**Dependencies**:

```
fastapi==0.95.2
uvicorn==0.22.0
```

Install dependencies using

```bash
